# AI-ollama-resume-extractor

As part of my learning, I worked on a small project where I used these tools to perform a simple yet insightful task: data extraction from resumes. The goal was to leverage the Ollama model and LangChain framework to extract useful information from resumes, providing a hands-on experience with generative AI technologies.

This project marks my first step into the world of generative AI, and I believe learning and building with these tools can provide immense value. The technologies I explored have great potential, and I encourage anyone interested in AI to dive in and start building. Itâ€™s a great way to learn, grow, and stay ahead in this fast-evolving field.

ðŸ’¡ The Future of AI: One of the most exciting trends right now is RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), which is transforming how we build AI applications. By combining the power of large language models (LLMs) with external data retrieval systems, RAG offers a new dimension of accuracy and context, enabling us to build even more powerful and efficient AI applications.

LangChain is at the forefront of this movement, enabling seamless integration of external data sources, making it easier to create RAG-powered applications. With its versatility and ability to connect with various tools, LangChain is helping developers unlock the full potential of generative AI.
